<!-- summary -->

A customizable music bot that allows playing audio of _YouTube_'s video in _Discord_'s voice channels.

Also capable of queuing videos and pruning message in a text channel. And if you want more features, you could add them to the commands folder!

## üí° Motivation

At the beginning of the quarantine, my friends and I began to use the voice channel more in our _Discord_'s server. They tried to play music from the same microphone they speak... and yes, it sounded terrible. After that, I challenge myself to develop one.

It still has some things to work out. Such as searching for videos through messages. Yet, I'm pretty proud of this.

## üöß Prerequisites

- _[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)_ with _npm_ (short for _Node Package Manager_)
- Token from [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Download the repository

If you have installed _Git_, you can clone it with:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gonza7aav/discord-music-bot.git
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Install

1. From the repository's folder, you need to run:

```shell
npm intall
```

2. Place your token in the `config.json` file

3. (Optional) Customize the default values as desired

4. (Optional) Customize the values of each command

If you want to develop your commands, I'll recommend using the `help.js` file which is completely commented.

## üöÄ Usage

To start the bot, run:

```shell
npm start
```

Inside a pre-configured _Discord_'s text channel, you can send the `!help` to get more information about the use of each command.
